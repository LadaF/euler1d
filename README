Euler1D computes euler equations for ideal compressible gas in one dimension.
Initial conditions are discontinuous in the form of Riemann problem or smooth
and periodic in the form of sinusoidal wave.

All settings are stored in the file euler.conf. All options are commented.
Files anim.plot and animate.sh are sample Gnuplot and shell scripts for
generation of animations. Currently it produces mp4 files using ffmpeg. You
can change it to anything else.

Outputs of computations are stored in files rho.txt, u.txt, rhou.txt,
 e.txt, p.txt, m.txt (density, velocity, density*velocity, total energy,
 pressure, Mach number).

I would appreciate your feedback. You can contact me at
