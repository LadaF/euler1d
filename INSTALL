Program can be compiled by any Fortran 95 compiler. For GNU Fortran you can use

gfortran -O2 CUeuler.f90 euler1d.f90 -o euler1d

For other options try gfortran --help. If you use other compiler, simply type
it's name (f90,ifort ...) instead of gfortran.

Compiled exeutable eueler1d copy to any directory with files euler.conf,
animate.sh and anim.plot. If you want to produce animations using my scripts,
you must have installed Gnuplot and FFmpeg. Also for other initial conditions,
you will probably have to edit file anim.plot and change xrange and yrange
according to your computed data. Then simply run script ./animate.sh. Gnuplot
will then create jpg files for frames and then FFmpeg resulting mp4 file.

! Remark: program does compile succesfuly on gfortran 4.0.2 (SuSE 10.0), but
does not run correctly. With recent versions of GCC this should be fixed.
